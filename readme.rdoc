Dear Rubyists from all around Europe,

I regret to inform you that the public repository of this project will be temporarily down due to internal restructuring. We will be back on-line in a couple of days with an improved website, a clear roadmap and a much better communication strategy. All these changes aim at enhancing the overall experience of all collaborators and to secure a bright future for our community project.

I really would like to apologize for the inconvenience and the trouble I may cause. Hopefully, we will be joining our forces together this very week.

Rock On!
Javier.-
